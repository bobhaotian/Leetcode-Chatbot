Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.","Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

This Python solution uses the same logic as the provided Java solution. It first sorts the input array and then iterates through the array, checking each possible combination of three numbers to see if they sum to zero. If the sum is too large, it decreases the largest number; if the sum is too small, it increases the smallest number. If the sum is zero, it adds the three numbers to the result list and then moves on to the next unique set of three numbers.",FALSE

5,Next Permutation,"A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.","Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]

For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.","Example 1:

This solution uses a dictionary to maintain the values and their indices and a list to store the values. The insert operation is O(1) because we are checking the presence of a value in a dictionary and adding a value to a list. The remove operation is also O(1) because we are swapping the value with the last value in the list and then popping the last value, and deleting the value from the dictionary. The getRandom operation is O(1) because we are choosing a random element from the list. So, overall, all operations are O(1) on average.",FALSE

67,UTF-8 Validation,"Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).
A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)

            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.","Example 1:
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.","

        return count == 0
```

This is a linear time complexity solution. The idea behind the solution is to use the shifting operator to check the most significant bits of each number in the input list. Depending on the number of leading 1's in the binary form of the number, we determine how many bytes the current UTF-8 character needs. Then we check the next few numbers to see if they are valid continuation bytes. If we encounter any invalid situation, we return False. If we successfully check all numbers in the list, we return True.",FALSE

Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.","Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 26
Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26
So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.

Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).","Example 1:
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
Example 2:

In this solution, the people list is first sorted in descending order of height and in case of a tie, by the number of people in front.

```
This solution works by scanning the array from left to right, and whenever it finds a subarray where the difference between consecutive elements is the same, it counts the number of slices that can be made from this subarray. The count is added to the total result. The process continues until the end of the array. If the length of the subarray is less than 3, it means there are no slices that can be made from it, so it is ignored.

This solution works by iterating the array from the end to the start, and it uses a stack to keep track of possible (i, j) pairs. It ensures the stack is always in decreasing order, then it pops all numbers that are smaller than the current number, and those popped numbers are guaranteed to be larger than the previous s3. If the stack is not empty, then the new number is guaranteed to be smaller than s3 (because it's in the stack).

If it can, then it subtracts the length of the matchstick from the target length and moves on to the next matchstick.

This solution is similar to the C++ solution provided. It first sorts the nums array, then it iterates over the array in reverse order. For each element, it uses two pointers, left and right, to find the pairs of numbers that can form a triangle with the current number. If the sum of the numbers at the left and right pointers is greater than the current number, it means these numbers can form a triangle, and it adds the number of such pairs to the count. If the sum is not greater than the current number, it moves the left pointer to the right. The process continues until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer.

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

This python solution uses recursion and memoization to solve the problem. The helper function calculates the minimum price for the current needs. 

It first calculates the price without applying any special offers. Then it tries to apply each special offer. If the special offer can be applied, it calculates the new needs after applying the special offer and recursively calls the helper function to calculate the minimum price for the new needs. 

The calculated minimum price for the current needs is stored in the memo dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, the helper function returns the minimum price for the current needs.",FALSE

128,Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.
In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
The first effective comment takes precedence over others.
For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.
For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.
Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
","Example 1:
Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}
Example 2:
Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].","Here is a Python solution that uses a flag to keep track of whether we're within a block comment. It then checks each line for comments and removes them as necessary.


class Solution:
    def removeComments(self, source):
        in_block = False
        ans = []
        for line in source:
            i = 0
            if not in_block:
                newline = []
            while i < len(line):
                if line[i:i+2] == '/*' and not in_block:
                    in_block = True
                    i += 1
                elif line[i:i+2] == '*/' and in_block:
                    in_block = False
                    i += 1
                elif not in_block and line[i:i+2] == '//':
                    break
                elif not in_block:

            if newline and not in_block:
                ans.append("""".join(newline))
        return ans
```

This code iterates over each line in the source code. If it's not in a block comment, it checks for the start of a block comment or a line comment. If it finds one of these, it sets the flag or breaks the loop as necessary. If it doesn't find a comment, it adds the character to the new line. If it's in a block comment, it checks for the end of the block comment. If it finds the end, it resets the flag. When it has finished processing a line, if the new line is not empty and it's not in a block comment, it adds the new line to the answer.",FALSE

The class maintains a list of prefix products, where each element is the product of all the numbers before it in the stream. When a new number is added to the stream, it is multiplied with the last element in the prefix product list and appended to the list. When the product of the last k numbers is requested, the product of all numbers in the stream is divided by the product of the first (n-k) numbers.


class ProductOfNumbers:

    def __init__(self):
        self.A = [1]

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num == 0:
            self.A = [1]
        else:
            self.A.append(self.A[-1] * num)

    def getProduct(self, k: int) -> int:
        if k >= len(self.A): return 0
        return self.A[-1] // self.A[-k-1]
```
In the `add` method, if `num` is zero, we reset the prefix products list to `[1]` because any product including `0` is `0`. This enables us to correctly return `0` when the last `k` numbers include `0`.

In the `getProduct` method, if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the prefix products list, it means the last `k` numbers include `0`, so we return `0`. Otherwise, we return the division of the product of all numbers by the product of the first `(n-k)` numbers.

The time complexity for the `add` method is O(1). The time complexity for the `getProduct` method is also O(1). The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of integers added to the stream.",FALSE

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
","Example 1:
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Design a stream that returns the values in increasing order of their IDs by returning a chunk (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the chunks should result in a list of the sorted values.
Implement the OrderedStream class:
OrderedStream(int n) Constructs the stream to take n values.
String[] insert(int idKey, String value) Inserts the pair (idKey, value) into the stream, then returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.","Example:

Input

Output
[null, [], [""aaaaa""], [""bbbbb"", ""ccccc""], [], [""ddddd"", ""eeeee""]]

Explanation
// Note that the values ordered by ID is [""aaaaa"", ""bbbbb"", ""ccccc"", ""ddddd"", ""eeeee""].
OrderedStream os = new OrderedStream(5);
os.insert(3, ""ccccc""); // Inserts (3, ""ccccc""), returns [].
os.insert(1, ""aaaaa""); // Inserts (1, ""aaaaa""), returns [""aaaaa""].
os.insert(2, ""bbbbb""); // Inserts (2, ""bbbbb""), returns [""bbbbb"", ""ccccc""].
os.insert(5, ""eeeee""); // Inserts (5, ""eeeee""), returns [].
os.insert(4, ""ddddd""); // Inserts (4, ""ddddd""), returns [""ddddd"", ""eeeee""].
// Concatentating all the chunks returned:
// [] + [""aaaaa""] + [""bbbbb"", ""ccccc""] + [] + [""ddddd"", ""eeeee""] = [""aaaaa"", ""bbbbb"", ""ccccc"", ""ddddd"", ""eeeee""]

        return chunk
```
The above Python solution creates an OrderedStream class with methods to initialize the stream and insert values. The ordered stream is stored in a list buffer. When a value is inserted, it is stored at the appropriate index in the buffer, and the largest chunk of values in order is returned. The list is iterated from the current pointer until a None value is encountered or the end of the list is reached. The pointer is then updated to the next index.",FALSE
160,Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary,"You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any integer from nums with another integer between 1 and limit, inclusive.
The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.
Return the minimum number of moves required to make nums complementary.","Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,4,3], limit = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).
nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[2] + nums[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
nums[3] + nums[0] = 3 + 1 = 4.
Therefore, nums[i] + nums[n-1-i] = 4 for every i, so nums is complementary.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,1], limit = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: In 2 moves, you can change nums to [2,2,2,2]. You cannot change any number to 3 since 3 > limit.

Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
Example 2:

Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]

This solution works by iterating over the unique numbers in the input list, and checking if the number, when subtracted from k, exists in the list. If it does, it counts the number of pairs that can be made and increments the result by this amount. It also updates the counts of the numbers used in the pairs.

In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.
Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.","Example 1:

Input: maze = [[""+"",""+"",""."",""+""],[""."",""."",""."",""+""],[""+"",""+"",""+"","".""]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.
It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.
Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.
Example 2:

Input: maze = [[""+"",""+"",""+""],[""."",""."","".""],[""+"",""+"",""+""]], entrance = [1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.
Example 3:

Input: maze = [[""."",""+""]], entrance = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no exits in this maze.","Here is the Python solution which follows the same logic as the provided C++ solution. It uses Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path to the nearest exit.

This solution uses binary search to find the column with the maximum element and then checks if this element is a peak.

179,K Radius Subarray Averages,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.
The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.
Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.
The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.
For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.","Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:
- avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
  Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
- For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
- For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
- avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [100000], k = 0
Output: [100000]
Explanation:
- The sum of the subarray centered at index 0 with radius 0 is: 100000.
  avg[0] = 100000 / 1 = 100000.

'0' means the cell is empty, while'1' means the cell has a security device.
There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:
The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.
Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.
Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.","Example 1:

Input: bank = [""011001"",""000000"",""010100"",""001000""]
Output: 8
Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]

 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
 * bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
 * bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
 * bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row.
This is because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

Input: bank = [""000"",""111"",""000""]
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows.","

This solution firstly counts the number of laser devices in each row and stores them in the 'beams' list. Then, if there are no two rows with devices, it returns 0.

- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.

Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.","Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is [2,1], which is the same as the initial array.","

In this solution, we first create a list of odd index elements and sort them in non-increasing order. We then create another list of even index elements and sort them in non-decreasing order.

Here, 'bisect_right' function is used to find the position in the sorted 'presum' array where 'query' can be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The index 'i' indicates the end of the valid subsequence, so the size of the subsequence is 'i-1'. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n + m log n), where n is the length of 'nums' and m is the length of 'queries'. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the sorted 'nums' and 'presum'.",FALSE

You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:
You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.

195,Most Profitable Path in a Tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
At every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:
the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,
the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.
The game goes on as follows:
Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.
At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.
For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.
If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.
Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.","Example 1:

Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.
Example 2:

Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280.","

You must buy exactly two chocolates in such a way that you still have some non-negative leftover money. You would like to minimize the sum of the prices of the two chocolates you buy.
Return the amount of money you will have leftover after buying the two chocolates. If there is no way for you to buy two chocolates without ending up in debt, return money. Note that the leftover must be non-negative.
","Example 1:
Input: prices = [1,2,2], money = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Purchase the chocolates priced at 1 and 2 units respectively. You will have 3 - 3 = 0 units of money afterwards. Thus, we return 0.
Example 2:
Input: prices = [3,2,3], money = 3

Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]

Return the product matrix of grid.","Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [[24,12],[8,6]]
Explanation: p[0][0] = grid[0][1] * grid[1][0] * grid[1][1] = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
p[0][1] = grid[0][0] * grid[1][0] * grid[1][1] = 1 * 3 * 4 = 12
p[1][0] = grid[0][0] * grid[0][1] * grid[1][1] = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8

This Python code is following the structure of the provided Java code exactly. It first calculates the minimum value of all numbers in the array using bitwise AND operation. If the minimum value is greater than zero, it returns 1. Then it goes through the array again, each time checking if the current temporary value is zero. If so, it increments the counter and sets the temporary value to the current number. Otherwise, it performs a bitwise AND operation with the current number. If it reaches the end of the array and the temporary value is still greater than zero, it decrements the counter. Finally, it returns the counter.",FALSE

There are n different types of metals available, and you have access to k machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.
For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j. Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.
Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.
All alloys must be created with the same machine.

Explanation: It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.
To create 2 alloys we need to buy the:
- 2 units of metal of the 1st type.
- 2 units of metal of the 2nd type.

- 5 units of metal of the 2nd type.
- 0 units of metal of the 3rd type.
In total, we need 5 * 1 + 5 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 15 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.

Explanation: 
For index = 0, length = 9 and width = 3. Diagonal length = sqrt(9 * 9 + 3 * 3) = sqrt(90) ≈ 9.487.
For index = 1, length = 8 and width = 6. Diagonal length = sqrt(8 * 8 + 6 * 6) = sqrt(100) = 10.
So, the rectangle at index 1 has a greater diagonal length therefore we return area = 8 * 6 = 48.
